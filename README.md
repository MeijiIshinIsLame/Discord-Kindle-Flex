This was a program made for me to set my kindle book progress as a discord status. I later found out that logging into discord as a bot was a bannable offense now, so I tried taking the approach of renaming the window and setting my game status as that. Unfortunately discord did not recognize it so I've probably gotta rename a window discord does recognize to make this work. 

Unfortunately, that means that this thing basically has no hope of ever being something other people will want to use so it's now for my own personal use lol.
